# Introduction to Raspberry Pi - Featuring Setup and Basic Python

- Pre-workshop activities: 15 min 
- Introductory presentation: 5-10 min
- Hands-on activities: 80 min

## Why Program with Raspberry Pi?

The [Raspberry Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.com/){:target="_blank"} world is an accessible introduction to single board computers for anyone from casual hobbyists to professionals. While microcontrollers such as those from [Arduino](https://www.arduino.cc/){:target="_blank"} are very rudimentary computers capable of running a single program limited to kilobytes in size, the Raspberry Pi is effectively a compact desktop PC capable of running a modern Linux operating system (with the exception of the [Pico](https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/raspberry-pi-pico/){:target="_blank"} of course). This opens up various new possibilities for electronics and computing projects.

## Learning objectives

Participants will be able to know and do the following by the end of this workshop:

1. Setup the Raspberry Pi hardware and software.
2. Have a basic understanding of terminal commands to navigate and move files.
3. Terminal commands for updating and upgrading the Raspberry Pi.
4. Editing files with Nano.
5. Cut and paste programming and editing with terminal-based text editors.
6. Be able to wire simple breadboard circuits with an introductory level understanding of electronics.
7. Have an understanding of what types of problems can be solved with a Raspberry Pi.
8. Complete one or more of the following sample projects:
   - Chromium Kiosk Computer: [https://pimylifeup.com/raspberry-pi-kiosk/](https://pimylifeup.com/raspberry-pi-kiosk/){:target="_blank"}
   - Spotify Jukebox: [https://pimylifeup.com/raspberry-pi-spotify/](https://pimylifeup.com/raspberry-pi-spotify/){:target="_blank"}
   - NearbyAirtraffic Tracker: [https://pimylifeup.com/raspberry-pi-flightradar24/](https://pimylifeup.com/raspberry-pi-flightradar24/){:target="_blank"}
